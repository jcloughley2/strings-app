    When we delete a variable, we need to make sure to delete any dimension values associated with it. A variable may serve as a spawn variable to multiple conditional variables and so multiple dimension values may need ot be deleted. 

    We used to have a restriction that a conditional varaible must have at least one spawn variable. We should move away from that restriction. A conditional variable can have zero or more spawn variables.
